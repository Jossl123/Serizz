## Introduction

#### - Guide Objective

  This document aims to guide the user through the discovery of our web app SeriZZ. If anything seems confusing or missing, feel free to contact technical support for more information.

## Getting Started

#### - Quick Start

SeriZZ is a web application for tracking all types of TV series. It allows users to stay informed by following their favorite series, keeping track of their progress by marking watched episodes, providing reviews/ratings, and connecting with others who share similar interests by following other users.

#### - User Interface

Navigation on the site is simple and quick, with just a click on various buttons in the header bar.

Upon entering the site, the user is on the homepage displaying the Hall Of Fame, featuring the top 4 most-watched series in our database. The user also has access to their personal space at the bottom of this homepage, which can also be accessed directly by clicking on "See more."

List and description of buttons:

- "Series":
    Allows access to the list of all series in our database. Users can perform filtered searches by name, elements in the synopsis, ratings, genre, and more.

- "Followed":
    Provides access to a personal space where users can see the series they follow, track their progress on watched episodes, and view completed series (fully watched).

- "Users":
    Allows access to the list of site users, providing information such as email, nationality, or username. Users can perform searches by email or filter by user role (super administrator, administrator, user). Access to the list of followed users is available by clicking on "Your followed users." Users can follow other users, view their pages, and perform other actions from buttons on the right.

- "Settings":
    This tab is used for modifying personal information displayed on the user's account; all information is editable.

- Burger Menu:
    In the burger menu at the top right of the application, options for registration, login, or logout are available.

#### - Administrator Categories and Various Features

##### Categories

- "Add Series":
    On this page, the administrator can send requests to the OMDB (Open Movie Database) directly through the search bar, adding a series to the site's database.

- "Admin Panel":
    Provides access to a table where unapproved reviews are stored. The administrator can choose to individually accept or reject a review, making it visible to all on the series page or removing it from the database.

##### Features

- Embody:
    The administrator can, from the list of users, take control of any account (except super-administrator), experiencing the site as a regular user and testing features from that account.

- Series Modifications:
    The administrator can manually modify information about a series directly from its page.

- Ban:
    An administrator can choose to ban a user account from the site on the user's page, restricting access completely.
