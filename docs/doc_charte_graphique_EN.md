### Logo :

Our logo, which you can see below, was designed and created by the team itself.
It is made up of several colors and elements, which will be detailed below.

<img src="app/public/images/logo.png" alt="Texte alternatif" width="250" height="250" />

#### Description :
The letters are cream with black borders and gray shading. The text is integrated into a lightning bolt with black outlines, giving a dynamic, energetic effect to the logo, which also represents the spirit of our company. In addition, abstract black shapes, resembling splashes or ink blots, surround the lightning bolt to accentuate the dynamic effect.

### Colors choice :

List of colors used :

- Font colors : **#b1b1b1** (white-grey)

The colors have been chosen to make the site look modern, simple and in the spirit of the cinema (dark colors).

The background image in the header bar is determined by the page the user is on. If the user is on the home page, there will be the image of the poster for the N°1 series in the hall of fame. If he's on the page of a specific series, it will take part of the poster of the series consulted.
